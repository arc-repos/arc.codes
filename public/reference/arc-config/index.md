# `.arc-config`
## Configure individual Lambda function properties

- `runtime` - Officially supported: one of `nodejs10.x`, `nodejs8.10`, `python3.7`, `python3.6`, or `ruby2.5`
  - Also configurable, but not officially supported by Architect: `java8`, `go1.x`, `dotnetcore2.1`
- `memory` - number, between 128 MB and 3008 MB in 64 MB increments
  - Memory size also directly correlates with CPU speed; higher memory levels are available in more capable Lambda clusters
- `timeout` - number, in seconds (max 900)
- `concurrency` - number, `0` to AWS account maximum (if not present, concurrency is unthrottled)
- `layers` - Lambda layer ARNs (must be in the same region as deployed)
- `policies` - Additional Lambda role policy ARNs
