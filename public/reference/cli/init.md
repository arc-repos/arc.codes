# arc init
## Quickly bootstrap an `app.arc` file

Running `arc init` in an empty directory will create a default `app.arc` named after that directory with one default function `src/http/get-index`.

Edit the `app.arc` to add functions and re-run `arc init` to generate local code. This command is intended to be run and re-run; it will only generate files if they do not already exist.
