# .arc Project Layout

One more thing: comments! Add comments in their own lines, or inline, with a `#`. 

## Example

Ok, let's provision a basic project with a simple `.arc` manifest!

Given the following `.arc` file:

```arc
# this is going to be great!
@app
testapp

@events
hello

@html
get /

@json
get /posts # the posts go here
```

Running `npx create` creates the following code:

```bash
/
├── src
│   ├── events
│   │   └── hello/
│   ├── html
│   │   └── get-index/
│   ├── json
│   │   └── get-posts/
│   └── shared/
├── .arc
└── package.json
```

The generated code was also immediately deployed to the built-in `staging` environment. Subsequent edits to the local code are deployed by running `npx deploy`.

Happy with staging? Ship a release to production by running `ARC_DEPLOY=production npx deploy`. 

Time to celebrate! ✨
